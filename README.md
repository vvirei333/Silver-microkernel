# silver_microkernel

A hobby microkernel for AArch64 (ARM64) written in Rust. The foundation is
bare-metal Rust (`no_std`), with drivers and services in C/C++ planned on top
of it. Cross-platform development: Windows and Linux (Arch) share the same
code — only the build commands and toolchain setup differ.

Target platform: QEMU `virt` machine (ARM Virt Board), Cortex-A72 CPU.

## What already works

- [x] Bare-metal boot: `_start`, custom linker script, `.bss` zeroing
- [x] PL011 UART console input/output with echo and line editing
- [x] ARM64 exception handler: kernel panic with error code and address
- [x] Physical memory map + page frame allocator (bitmap)
- [x] Kernel heap + Rust global allocator (`alloc`: `Box`, `Vec`)
- [x] GICv2 + ARM Generic Timer (IRQ 30, 100 Hz tick)
- [x] Round-robin scheduler: dynamic `spawn(program, argument)`, `yield`, `sleep`, `exit`
- [x] Lifecycle cleanup: address spaces, mailboxes, wait queues and owned mutexes
- [x] Blocking mutex with FIFO wait queue, ownership tracking and RAII guard
- [x] Bounded IPC: 16-message mailboxes, blocking send/backpressure and receive timeouts
- [x] IPC cleanup: queued-message disposal and blocked-sender wakeups on receiver exit
- [x] System calls via `svc #0` (number in x8, arguments in x0-x5)
- [x] Nameserver: register/lookup/unregister plus stale-owner cleanup
- [x] Condition variable: per-mailbox wait queues, targeted wakeups and timed waits
- [x] Counting semaphore + bounded channel with backpressure
- [x] MMU: 4-level tables, 4 KB granules, high-half kernel via TTBR1
- [x] Three userspace ELFs with checked `PT_LOAD` loading and BSS zeroing
- [x] Silver2Shell: interactive `help` / `fastfetch`, wolf ASCII art and clean MVP boot
- [x] Shell syscalls: nonblocking `SYS_READ`, `SYS_UPTIME` and checked `SYS_MEMINFO`
- [x] Per-task TTBR0 spaces: independent ELF image, fixed-VA stack and private page
- [x] Growable per-task heap: sparse 2 MB window, `brk`, zero-fill and cleanup on exit
- [x] Userspace `malloc/free`: first-fit free list, split, coalesce and `brk` trim
- [x] Userspace `GlobalAlloc`: `Box`, growable `Vec` and deallocation in EL0
- [x] W^X user mappings: R-X text, R-- rodata, RW-NX data/heap/stack/private memory
- [x] No kernel image, kernel data, heap, kernel stacks or MMIO in user TTBR0
- [x] Tasks in EL0 (Ring 3): user stacks and SVC-only kernel access
- [x] Checked copyin/copyout with permission validation, `LDTR/STTR` and PAN enabled
- [x] EL0 fault containment: bad user accesses kill the task, not the kernel
- [x] High-half and removed-alias probes: both fault without stopping other tasks
- [ ] Drivers and richer process management (kill, wait, credentials)

## Requirements

- Rust stable with the `aarch64-unknown-none` target
- QEMU with AArch64 system emulation

### Windows

```bash
# Rust + target
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-none

# QEMU: installer from https://www.qemu.org/download/#windows
# (path below is the installer's default)
```

### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S qemu-system-aarch64 rustup
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-none
```

## Build and run

Windows (Git Bash), interactive shell:

```bash
export PATH="$(cygpath -u "$USERPROFILE")/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
cd "F:/My Projects/Silver microkernel"
cargo build --target aarch64-unknown-none --no-default-features --features no_std
"/c/Program Files/qemu/qemu-system-aarch64.exe" \
  -machine virt -cpu cortex-a72 -m 128M -nographic \
  -kernel target/aarch64-unknown-none/debug/silver_microkernel
```

Linux, interactive shell:

```bash
cargo build --target aarch64-unknown-none --no-default-features --features no_std
qemu-system-aarch64 \
  -machine virt -cpu cortex-a72 -m 128M -nographic \
  -kernel target/aarch64-unknown-none/debug/silver_microkernel
```

Type `help` or `fastfetch` at the `silver2>` prompt. Backspace edits the current
line. Press `Ctrl-A`, then `X`, to quit QEMU. For an unattended smoke test,
prefix QEMU with `timeout 5s`; exit code 124 then means the kernel stayed alive.

`Cargo.toml` has `std` (default host stub), `no_std` (bare metal) and
`demo-tasks` (opt-in regression programs). The default bare-metal build starts
only idle, nameserver and Silver2Shell for a clean console. To run the older
fault/VM/allocator/IPC demos instead, use `--features no_std,demo-tasks`.
`build.rs` automatically builds and embeds the demo, nameserver and silvershell
ELFs; no separate userspace command is needed.

## Memory model

The kernel is linked at high virtual addresses but loaded at low physical
addresses. The assembly boot stub builds temporary low/high aliases, enables
the MMU, branches to the high PC, and removes the kernel's low identity map.

```text
TTBR1 (EL1 only):  0xFFFF000000000000 + PA -> kernel image, heap, stacks, MMIO
TTBR0 (per task): own ELF + sparse heap + own fixed-VA stack + private page
```

The scheduler changes only TTBR0_EL1 and flushes stale TLB entries. Its EL1
code and SP_EL1 stack remain mapped through TTBR1_EL1. Every user task gets
an independently loaded ELF image at `0x40000000`, an 8 KB stack at
`0x7FE00000`, and a private 4 KB page at `0x0000_0080_0000_0000`. Equal VAs
in different tasks have different physical backing. VM A/B verify the private
page, ELF BSS and heap by reading back only their own values.

`SYS_BRK` manages a byte-granular program break in a reserved 2 MB heap window
at `0x40200000`. Growth maps zeroed RW-NX pages on demand; shrinking unmaps and
frees whole pages; failed growth rolls back partial mappings. Reaping frees
all remaining heap frames.

`userspace/src/allocator.rs` provides explicit 16-byte-aligned `malloc/free`.
It uses first-fit, splits large free blocks, keeps the list address-sorted and
coalesces adjacent blocks. Freeing a tail block also shrinks `brk`, returning
whole pages to the kernel. Tests verify same-address reuse, neighbor integrity
and restoration of the initial program break.

The demo ELF registers this allocator as `#[global_allocator]`, so `Box`, `Vec`
and default `GlobalAlloc` reallocation work in EL0. Layouts requiring alignment
above 16 bytes and OOM terminate only the current task with diagnostics. The
EL0 test grows a 32-element `Vec`, checks `Box::new(42)` and verifies `brk` trim
after both values are dropped.

The userspace linker emits separate R-X, R-- and RW `PT_LOAD` segments. The
loader accepts static ELF64/AArch64 `ET_EXEC` files inside a 2 MB image window,
rejects W+X or incompatible page permissions, copies file bytes into fresh
frames and zero-fills BSS. There is no shared kernel `.text` / `.rodata` alias
left in TTBR0.

All demo tasks except idle run at EL0t and enter the kernel only through
`svc #0`. Copyin/copyout validates mapping and read/write permissions through
the current TTBR0, then uses unprivileged `LDTRB/STTRB` while SCTLR.PAN is
enabled. Read-only and unmapped output buffers are rejected before a receive
can block.

Two intentional probes prove isolation: task 15 reads
`0xFFFF000040000000` (high-half kernel) and task 16 reads
`0x0000000040080000` (the old kernel text alias). Each must produce one
`TASK FAULT` with `EC=0x24`; all other tasks continue running.

`spawn(program, argument)` selects a registered ELF and passes an argument to
its entry point. The lifecycle demo dynamically spawns a child, checks the
argument, registers/unregisters a name, exits while holding a mutex and proves
that reaping releases it. Nameserver RPC uses selective receive so unrelated
messages cannot be consumed as lookup responses.

Each mailbox holds at most 16 messages. A sender blocks on `not_full` while the
queue is full; removing any message wakes one sender. `SYS_RECEIVE(buffer, ticks)`
uses `0` for polling, `u64::MAX` for infinite waiting and any other value as a
relative timer-tick timeout. It returns `SYSCALL_TIMEOUT` (`u64::MAX - 1`) on
expiry. Receiver exit clears queued messages, wakes all blocked senders and makes
their sends fail instead of recreating the dead mailbox. Demos verify timeout,
backpressure on the seventeenth send, FIFO delivery and exit wakeup.
